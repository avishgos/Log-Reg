# Logistic-Regression

Logistic regression is another technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics.
It is the go-to method for binary classification problems (problems with two class values). In this post you will discover the logistic regression algorithm for machine learning.
The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function was developed by statisticians to describe properties of population growth in ecology, 
rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment. Itâ€™s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1,
but never exactly at those limits.


In this repository, you can see many files related to Logistic Regression. These contains various methods of using Logistic Regression on various datasets so you can clearly understand,how your algorithm is working. All these datasets are enough for you to understand the working of Logistic Regression.
